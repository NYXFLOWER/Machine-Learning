# Statistical Learning
> *If a system can improve its performance by performing a process, this is learning.*

## Object - Data

*Numbers, text, images, video, audio and their combinations*

- Extracting data features ->  Abstract out a data type ->  Discovery knowledge in data -> Analysis and forecasting data
- The basic assumption about data is that the data with a common attribute, such as data in some database, have certain statistical laws. In this case, we can process data by means of probability and statistics.
    - Using random variables to describe the features in data - continuous random variable and discrete random variable
    - Using probability distribution to describe the statistical law of data

## Purpose - Analysis & Predication

*by building a probabilistic statistical model*

- The general purpose is to determine which model to learn and how to learn the model, considering the learning efficiency, such that the model can make accurate prediction and analyses.

## Method

Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning

- Steps to implement statistical learning methods
    1. Get a finite **training set**
    2. Determine the **hypothetical space** that contains all possible models
    3. Determine the criteria for model selection (**strategy**)
    4. Implement the **algorithm** for finding the optimal model
    5. Using the optimal model predict and analyze new data
